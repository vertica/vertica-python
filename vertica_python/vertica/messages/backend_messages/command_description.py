CommandDescription message -- part of the response to a Describe request message.

This response informs the client about the type of command being executed.
If the command is a parameterized INSERT statement, the copy_rewrite field may 
include a semantically-equivalent COPY STDIN statement. Clients can choose to 
run this statement instead to achieve better performance when loading many 
batches of parameters.
