Execute message

In the extended query protocol, the frontend sends a Execute message once a
portal exists. Execute doesn't cause RowDescription response message to be
issued, so the frontend should issue Describe before issuing Execute, to ensure
that it knows how to interpret the result rows it will get back.

The Execute message specifies the portal name and a maximum result-row count.
Currently, Vertica backend will ignore this result-row count and send all the
rows regardless of what you put here.
