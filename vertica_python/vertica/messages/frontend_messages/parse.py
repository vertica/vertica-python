Parse message

In the extended query protocol, the frontend first sends a Parse message, which
contains a textual query string. The query string leaves certain values
unspecified with parameter placeholders (i.e. question mark '?').

The response is either ParseComplete or ErrorResponse. The query string cannot
include more than one SQL statement; else an ErrorResponse is reported. The
error message would be something like
  "Cannot insert multiple commands into a prepared statement"
