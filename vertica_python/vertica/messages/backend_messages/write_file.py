WriteFile message

In the copy-local protocol, the server may send a WriteFile message when it
receives a batch of copy data. If the COPY FROM LOCAL command uses the
REJECTED DATA and/or EXCEPTIONS parameters, this message contains content of
rejected rows or exceptions output files. If the command uses the
RETURNREJECTED parameters instead, this message is a series of row numbers
saying which rows in the load were rejected.
