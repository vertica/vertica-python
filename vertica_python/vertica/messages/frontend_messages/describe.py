Describe message

In the extended query protocol, the frontend sends a Describe message, which
specifies the name of an existing prepared statement.

The first response is a ParameterDescription message describing the parameters
needed by the statement. The second response is a RowDescription message
describing the rows that will be returned when the statement is eventually
executed (or a NoData message if the statement will not return rows). The third
response is a CommandDescription message describing the type of command to be
executed and any semantically-equivalent COPY statement.
